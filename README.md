# ADAPT Standard
The ADAPT Standard is a data schema, set of standard data type defintions and unit of measure abbeviations designed for the business-to-business transfer of agricultural production data.

It is the successor to the [AgGateway ADAPT Framework](https://github.com/adapt/adapt) released in 2015 that served as a software plugin toolkit to read proprietary files. Unlike the earlier toolkit, the ADAPT Standard does not have any software dependencies. It is data only.
